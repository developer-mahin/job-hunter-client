# JOB-HUNTER

## Overview

- State Management: Redux Toolkit is used to manage global state, including user authentication and post management.
- Data Fetching: RTK Query, in combination with Axios, is used to fetch data from the backend APIs, including creating, retrieving, and updating posts, as well as managing likes and comments.
- Form Validation: Zod is employed to validate user input in forms, such as login, registration, and profile updates, to prevent invalid data from being submitted.
